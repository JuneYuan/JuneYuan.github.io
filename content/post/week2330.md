Q. regarding the third item, I'm not so clear with what cloud native developers do, and how to develop expertise in cloud-native technologies. I played with docker, cube commands a bit, which is definitely not enough to be called "understand"

A. I apologize for any confusion, and I'm more than happy to clarify. Cloud-native developers design, build, and manage applications that run on cloud platforms and leverage the benefits of the cloud environment. This typically involves building applications as microservices, using containers for deployment, automating infrastructure, and implementing more scalable and resilient systems.

Here are some key aspects of developing expertise in cloud-native technologies:

1. **Learn containerization tools**: Gain an understanding of Docker, including Dockerfiles, images, and containers. Get comfortable with creating Docker images, managing containers, and using Docker Compose to manage multiple-container applications.

2. **Study container orchestration**: Deepen your understanding of Kubernetes. Learn about key concepts, including clusters, nodes, pods, services, deployments, and configMaps. Know how to create and manage a Kubernetes cluster, deploy applications, scale them, and perform rolling updates or rollbacks.

3. **Understand microservices architecture**: Familiarize yourself with the concept of microservices and its advantages compared to monolithic applications. Study communication patterns between microservices, e.g., REST APIs, gRPC, or message brokers, and learn about API gateways and service meshes.

4. **Master cloud platforms**: Get hands-on experience with at least one major cloud platform: AWS, GCP, or Azure. Understand their offerings related to containerization, serverless computing, databases, and other services. You may also want to achieve a relevant cloud certification to strengthen your credentials.

5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Learn tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation that enable you to manage and provision cloud infrastructure using code, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment.

6. **CI/CD tools and practices**: Gain proficiency with continuous integration and continuous deployment tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, CircleCI). Automate application build, test, and deployment steps in response to code changes.

7. **Monitoring, logging, and observability**: Familiarize yourself with tools and practices that provide visibility into your application's health and performance. Learn how to use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and Jaeger, among others.

8. **Security and compliance**: Understand how to secure containerized applications, protect sensitive data, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

To develop expertise in cloud-native technologies, you can start by setting up a learning path that covers these aspects. Online courses, tutorials, and documentation from official sources are a great way to start. Engage in hands-on projects to build practical experience with the technologies and tools. Consider joining cloud-native and container-related communities, attending meetups or webinars, and following blogs and industry experts to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.

As you progress on this learning path, your understanding of cloud-native technologies and practices will improve, making you well-equipped to work as a cloud-native developer or engineer.


Q. back to your previous answer of 10 items, how long could one make progress prominently in so many areas, and how can I manage to achieve that? I never lack the experience of setting goals, making plans and executing, however, the progress is often too slow than planned, and the goal becomes less than achievable.

A. It's important to remember that everyone's learning speed and capacity are different. Progressing in multiple areas at once can indeed be challenging. However, setting realistic goals, prioritizing your learning, and consistently reviewing your progress can help you manage your efforts effectively.

Here are some tips to make progress in multiple areas without getting overwhelmed:

**1. Set realistic goals**: Break down your overall goal into several smaller, manageable objectives. Analyze the time and effort required to achieve each, and ensure each goal is realistic given your existing commitments and available time.

**2. Prioritize learning**: Identify the areas where you need the most improvement or that align closely with the job positions you're targeting. Focus on those areas first before moving on to less-critical topics.

**3. Create a structured learning plan**: Assign time estimates to each topic or subtopic and create a learning schedule to help you stay organized. Allocate dedicated time on a daily or weekly basis for learning.

**4. Track your progress**: Regularly review your progress and adjust your learning plan as needed. If you find that you are not meeting your expectations, reevaluate your goals, and make necessary revisions to your plan.

**5. Get hands-on experience**: Engage in practical projects or contribute to open-source projects that involve the technologies and concepts you're learning. Hands-on experience helps reinforce your understanding and makes a visible difference in your skillset.

**6. Learn from multiple sources**: Utilize various resources like online courses, tutorials, blogs, podcasts, or books to get a well-rounded understanding of each topic. Varying your resources can make learning more engaging and effective.

**7. Set milestones and deadlines**: Set achievable milestones and deadlines for each objective. This will help you stay focused and motivated, avoiding procrastination.

**8. Avoid multitasking**: Focus on one task or topic at a time, as trying to learn several things at once can hinder your progress.

**9. Take breaks and manage stress**: Ensure you have regular breaks, maintain a healthy work-life balance, and engage in activities that help you recharge and manage stress.

**10. Be patient and persistent**: Learning multiple skills takes time, and there will be ups and downs in your progress. Maintain a positive mindset, be patient with the process, and stay persistent in your efforts.

Remember, the time required to make visible progress will vary for each individual. It may take several months or even longer, depending upon your current expertise, learning speed, and goal complexity. The key is to remain patient, consistent, and committed to your learning plan, and over time, you'll definitely see improvements in your skillset and knowledge.
