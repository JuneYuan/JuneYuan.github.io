+ The problem: port in use
+ diagnose: `lsof -i [...]`
+ diagnose further: `ps -o -p`
+ tip: 


```GPT
the agent process (PID 803) is started by the system's root process (PID 1) and is the parent process of the other processes using the port (PIDs 1123 and 1192).

Since you're on MacOS, the agent process might be controlled by launchd, which is the service management framework used by MacOS. If a service is configured to keep alive, launchd will automatically restart it whenever it exits.

can temporarily unload a service from launchd without removing it permanently.

1. Identify the plist file: Services in launchd are defined by property list (plist) files. You'll need to find the plist file associated with your service. These files are usually located in one of the following directories:

/Library/LaunchDaemons
/Library/LaunchAgents
~/Library/LaunchAgents

2. Unload the service: Once you've found the plist file, you can unload the service with the launchctl unload command:

sudo launchctl unload /path/to/com.example.agent.plist


You can manage services in launchd with the launchctl command. Here are some common launchctl commands:

launchctl list: Lists all services currently loaded in launchd.
launchctl start <label>: Starts the service with the given label.
launchctl stop <label>: Stops the service with the given label.
launchctl load <path>: Loads a service into launchd from a plist file.
launchctl unload <path>: Unloads a service from launchd.


When you're done with your local-statsd-logger program, you can reload the agent service with the launchctl load command:

sudo launchctl load /path/to/com.example.agent.plist
```

+ Spark pieces

```text
When you pass a DataFrame into a UDF, Spark needs to serialize the DataFrame to send it over the network to the worker nodes. However, DataFrames are not serializable because they are distributed data structures that represent large datasets partitioned across many nodes.
```

```text
I apologize for any confusion. Let's clarify those points:

Input Size: This refers to the amount of data read by the tasks in a stage from HDFS, local filesystem, S3, or any other data source. In your case, it's the data read from the Hive table.

Shuffle Write Size: This is the amount of data that is written to disk by tasks because a shuffle operation is required. A shuffle operation typically involves redistributing data across partitions, such as during a groupByKey or reduceByKey operation.

showString Operation: This is likely the operation related to the showString method called on a DataFrame or RDD. The actual operation depends on the context of your code. In Spark UI, the description of a stage often comes from the action that triggers the stage.

UDF Execution Time: The time spent executing a UDF is part of the task execution time but is not explicitly broken out in the Spark UI. It's not part of "data reading" or "shuffling". When I mentioned "operations other than data reading and shuffling", I was referring to all the computation that happens in a task, including UDF execution, other transformations, etc.

+ 什么是 dataframe, 什么是 RDD? 后者是底层结构，前者是一层封装吗？

+ partition 和 task

```text
In Apache Spark, the number of tasks is directly related to the number of partitions.

1. At the stage level: For transformations like map, filter, and others that operate on individual partitions, the number of tasks is equal to the number of partitions. Each task processes one partition of the data.

Detailed: In Spark, a stage is a sequence of transformations on an RDD or DataFrame that can be performed in a single pass, i.e., without shuffling data around. For transformations like map, filter, and others that operate on individual partitions, one task is created for each partition. Each task processes the data in one partition and applies the transformations defined in that stage. So, the number of tasks in a stage is equal to the number of partitions of the RDD or DataFrame being processed in that stage.

2. During a shuffle operation: For transformations like reduceByKey or join that involve a shuffle of data, the number of tasks in the next stage is determined by the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions configuration parameter (default is 200). Each task processes one partition of the shuffled data.

Detailed: Shuffle operations, such as groupByKey, reduceByKey, or join, involve redistributing data across partitions. The data is shuffled such that all records with the same key end up in the same partition. The number of partitions after the shuffle (and hence the number of tasks in the next stage) is determined by the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions configuration parameter (default is 200). Each task in the next stage processes one partition of the shuffled data.

3. When reading data: When you read data into Spark (like from HDFS, S3, etc.), the number of partitions (and hence tasks) is determined by the number of input splits. For example, when reading a file from HDFS, Spark creates one partition for each block of the file (128MB by default in HDFS).

    When reading data, Spark creates one task for each partition of the data. Here's how it works:

    3.1 Data Partitioning: When you read data into Spark, the data is divided into partitions. Each partition is a subset of the data. The number of partitions is determined by the data source and the configuration of your Spark job. For example, when reading a file from HDFS, Spark creates one partition for each block of the file (128MB by default in HDFS).
    
    3.2 Task Creation: Spark creates one task for each partition of the data. Each task is a unit of work that can be executed in parallel by an executor. A task processes the data in one partition and applies the transformations defined in your Spark job.
    
    3.3 Task Execution: The tasks are distributed to the executors for execution. Each executor can process multiple tasks concurrently, up to the number of cores available in the executor.

    So, in the context of reading data, the number of tasks is equal to the number of partitions. Each partition of the data is processed by one task.

+ broadcast join

```text
Yes, there is such a thing as a broadcast join in Spark. A broadcast join (also known as a broadcast hash join) is a type of join operation in Spark that can be more efficient than standard join operations for small datasets.

In a broadcast join, Spark sends a copy of the smaller DataFrame (the broadcast DataFrame) to each node in the cluster. This can be faster than the standard shuffle operation that Spark uses for join operations, especially when the broadcast DataFrame is small enough to fit in memory.
```

[GPT]
The join operation between poi_flat_df and compact_rules in your joint_df DataFrame could be a potential bottleneck if poi_flat_df is significantly larger than compact_rules.

The where condition and the rlike (Regular Expression LIKE) operations used in the checked_df DataFrame can be expensive, especially if the DataFrame being filtered (joint_flat_df) is large.

Writing the checked_df DataFrame to a table using insertInto could be slow if the target table is stored in a slow storage system, or if there's a lot of data to write.

1. The join operation between poi_flat_df and compact_rules. How to alleviate it?
2. The where condition and the rlike (Regular Expression LIKE) operations used in the checked_df DataFrame can be expensive, especially if the DataFrame being filtered (joint_flat_df) is large. Indeed so. But at least I've endeavored to shift from UDF to spark sql functions. How can I do better at this symptom?
3. Writing the checked_df DataFrame to a table using insertInto. It's parquet.

[GPT]
Join Operation: If compact_rules is a small DataFrame, you can use broadcast join to speed up the operation. In a broadcast join, Spark sends a copy of the smaller DataFrame to all nodes in the cluster, which can be faster than shuffling the data for a standard join. Here's how you can modify your join to use a broadcast join:

I'm still trying to imaging the standard join and broadcast join process. In a standard join, will both dataframe be shuffled among node?

[GPT]

In a standard join, the data is shuffled across the cluster. The data is shuffled such that all records with the same key end up in the same partition. The number of partitions after the shuffle (and hence the number of tasks in the next stage) is determined by the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions configuration parameter (default is 200). Each task in the next stage processes one partition of the shuffled data.

In a standard join operation in Spark, also known as a shuffle join, both DataFrames are indeed shuffled. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Partitioning**: Spark partitions both DataFrames based on the join keys. This means that rows with the same key are grouped together. This is done to ensure that all the data needed to perform the join operation on a particular key is located on the same node.

2. **Shuffling**: Spark then shuffles the data across the network so that each partition (i.e., each group of rows with the same key) ends up on the same node. This is necessary because the join operation is performed locally on each node.

3. **Joining**: Finally, Spark performs the join operation on each node, combining the rows from the two DataFrames based on the join keys.

This process can be resource-intensive, especially the shuffling step, as it involves transferring potentially large amounts of data across the network. If your data is skewed (i.e., some keys have significantly more rows than others), this can lead to some tasks taking much longer than others, slowing down the overall job.

In contrast, a broadcast join works differently:

1. **Broadcasting**: Spark sends a copy of the entire smaller DataFrame (the broadcasted DataFrame) to each node in the cluster.

2. **Joining**: Each node then performs the join operation locally, combining the rows from the larger DataFrame with the corresponding rows from the broadcasted DataFrame. 

Because the broadcast join avoids shuffling data, it can be much faster than a shuffle join, especially when one of the DataFrames is small enough to fit in memory on each node. However, if the broadcasted DataFrame is too large, it can cause out of memory errors.

it's really counterintuitive and full of surprise. For instance, when the job was taking several hours, I wasn't aware that optimization can reduce it to 15~20min. On the other hand, I also feel some uneasy: how can one do well with an optimization when he has not a clear target in mind?

[GPT]
I understand where you're coming from. The world of big data processing and optimization can indeed be complex and sometimes counterintuitive. Here are a few points that might help:

1. **Understanding Spark**: The first step to optimizing Spark jobs is understanding how Spark works - its architecture, its operations (transformations and actions), its execution model (e.g., lazy evaluation), and its data structures (e.g., RDDs, DataFrames, Datasets).

2. **Monitoring and Profiling**: Spark provides tools like the Spark web UI and logs which can help you understand the performance of your Spark job. They can show you how long each stage takes, how much data is being shuffled, how the data is partitioned, etc. This can help you identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

3. **Knowledge of Optimization Techniques**: There are many well-known techniques for optimizing Spark jobs, such as minimizing data shuffling, using broadcast variables, partitioning your data effectively, using the right data structures, etc. Understanding these techniques can help you optimize your Spark jobs.

4. **Iterative Process**: Optimization is often an iterative process. You make a change, monitor its impact, and then make further changes based on what you observe. It can involve a lot of trial and error.

5. **Community and Resources**: The Spark community is a great resource. There are many blogs, tutorials, and StackOverflow questions where people share their experiences and solutions. 

Remember, it's okay not to have a clear target in mind when you start optimizing. The goal is to make your job run faster or use fewer resources, and you often won't know how much improvement is possible until you start trying.

+ The association between Job and code
```text
The showString description you're seeing in your Spark job logs is associated with the show action in Spark.

The insertInto operation in Spark is an action that triggers the evaluation of the DataFrame and writes the result into a table. If you see multiple jobs with the description insertInto, it means that multiple write operations are being performed.

Hi, given a spark job code, will you be able to analyze which jobs and stages there will be?

[GPT]
As an AI, I can provide a general understanding of how Spark jobs and stages are created based on the operations in your code. However, the exact number of jobs and stages can depend on various factors such as data partitioning, Spark's physical execution plan, and optimizations made by Spark's Catalyst optimizer.

Here's a general guideline:

1. **Jobs**: Each action (like `count`, `collect`, `save`, etc.) triggers a new Spark job. So you can expect the number of jobs to be equal to the number of actions in your code.

2. **Stages**: Stages are formed based on transformations. Transformations can be narrow (like `map`, `filter`, etc.) or wide (like `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`, `join`, etc.). Narrow transformations allow data to be processed in a single stage, while wide transformations require shuffling of data and hence create new stages.

However, to get a precise understanding of the jobs and stages created by your Spark job, you would need to run the job and inspect the Spark UI or logs. The Spark UI provides a visual representation of the job execution where each job is broken down into stages and tasks, along with their status, duration, and other details.
